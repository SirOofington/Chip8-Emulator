# Chip8 Emulator

This is a basic Chip8 Emulator I built in C with SDL2.

## Usage

You can either drag your Chip8 rom onto the .exe, or manually enter the filepath running the program standalone.

This is a personal project of mine, so I would prefer to fix any issues found myself. However, feel free to point out any bugs or issues you find so I can make improvements in areas I may have overlooked.
